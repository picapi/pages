	It somewhat depends on which camp you choose to go to. The main focus at each camp is around a SANS course; which varies from camp to camp.
	At the Birmingham and Lancaster camps, you'd be taking <a href="https://uk.sans.org/course/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling">SEC504</a>;
	whereas at the London camp, you'd be taking <a href="https://uk.sans.org/course/windows-forensic-analysis">FOR500</a>. <br>It's likely that other secondary events
	will also take place during the camp alongside these courses!

	You do need a parent to sign you in and out at the start and end of the camp; but they don't need to stick around for the entire 6 days.
